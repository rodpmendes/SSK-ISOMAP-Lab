# Semi-Supervised K-ISOMAP via Complex Network Properties
Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for extracting meaningful low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional data. Although classical approaches such as ISOMAP and its variant K-ISOMAP are effective in preserving manifold structures, they remain unsupervised and may fail to leverage class-relevant information when partial labels are available. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised extension of K-ISOMAP that incorporates complex network properties into the construction of the k-nearest neighbor graph. Specifically, we employ betweenness centrality as a structural prior to weight graph edges, enabling the selection of more informative geodesic paths guided by partial supervision. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves class separability and clustering quality compared to traditional unsupervised approaches, while preserving the geometric integrity of the original data manifold.
